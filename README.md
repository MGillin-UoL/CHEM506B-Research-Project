# CHEM506B-Research-Project
This GitHub repository contains the code associated with Michael Gillin's Digital Chemistry: AI, Machine Learning, Robotics, and Automation MSc dissertation project at the University of Liverpool.

## Description

### Project Overview

This project involves developing a robotic workflow to analyse the crystallisation mechansisms and particle size distributions of a copper piroctone complex using laser light scattering.

## Prerequisites

The following software is required to run the code and acquire the appropriate data:

- Visual Studio Code (or other code editor) - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Python (Anaconda is recommended. To install, click "Free Download using the URL") - https://www.anaconda.com/

The following pieces of equipment are also required:

- UR5e robotic arm
- Robotiq Hand-E adaptive gripper
- HD Web camera (Logitech C920 HD Pro Webcam)
- Hotplate stirrer (Heidolph Instruments Hei-PLATE Mix 'n' Heat Core+)
- Sample vial(s)
- 20 mm magnetic stirrer bar(s)
- White/black background
- Mettler Toledo Quantos

## Usage

Below is a set of instructions for collecting data using the hardware listed before and the code provided.
